## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is the cornerstone of data analysis in Python. Let's start with the basics:

### Creating DataFrames

**Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary:**

Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary:
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 28, 32],
    'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Tokyo', 'Paris', 'Sydney'],
    'Salary': [70000, 80000, 90000, 75000, 85000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
print("DataFrame shape:", df.shape)
print("Data types:", df.dtypes)

### Basic DataFrame Operations

**Basic information about the DataFrame:**
- df.info() - Shows data types and null counts
- df.describe() - Shows statistical summary
- df.head(3) - Shows first 3 rows
- df.tail(2) - Shows last 2 rows

## Data Loading and Inspection

Real-world data comes in various formats. Let's explore different ways to load data:

**Loading data from different sources:**
- CSV file: df_csv = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
- Excel file: df_excel = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')

1. Window Functions
2. Common Table Expressions
3. Advanced Joins
4. Query Optimization
5. Performance Tuning

## Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across related rows without grouping the data.

### Basic Syntax

**Window function structure:**
SELECT 
    column1,
    column2,
    WINDOW_FUNCTION() OVER (
        PARTITION BY partition_column
        ORDER BY order_column
        ROWS BETWEEN start AND end
    ) AS result
FROM table_name;

### Ranking Functions

**Sample sales data setup:**
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT,
    salesperson VARCHAR(50),
    region VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE
);

**Ranking examples:**
- ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as row_num
- RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as rank_val
- DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as dense_rank_val
- NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as quartile

### Running Totals and Moving Averages

**Advanced window functions:**
- Running total: SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
- Moving average: AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
- Previous value: LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)
- Next value: LEAD(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs make complex queries more readable and enable recursive operations.

### Basic CTE

**Monthly sales analysis:**
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) as month,
        region,
        SUM(amount) as total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date), region
)
SELECT 
    month,
    region,
    total_sales,
    AVG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY region) as avg_monthly_sales
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month, region;

### Recursive CTE

**Organization hierarchy:**
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart ORDER BY level, name;

## Advanced Joins

Beyond basic joins, there are powerful techniques for complex data relationships.

### Self Joins

**Find employees and their managers:**
SELECT 
    e.name as employee,
    m.name as manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;

## Query Optimization

Optimizing queries is crucial for performance with large datasets.

### Index Usage

**Create indexes for better performance:**
- CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date ON sales(sale_date);
- CREATE INDEX idx_sales_region_date ON sales(region, sale_date);
- CREATE INDEX idx_sales_complex ON sales(region, salesperson, sale_date) INCLUDE (amount);

## Conclusion

These advanced SQL techniques will significantly improve your data analysis capabilities. Practice with real datasets to master these concepts and become a more effective data scientist.

### Next Steps:
- Practice window functions with time series data
- Implement CTEs in your analysis workflows
- Learn database-specific optimization techniques

- Use when population standard deviation unknown
- t = (x̄ - μ) / (s/√n)

**Steps:**
1. State hypotheses
2. Choose significance level
3. Calculate test statistic
4. Find p-value
5. Make decision

### Two-Sample Tests

**Independent t-test:**

**Interpretation:**
- r > 0.7: Strong positive correlation
- 0.3 < r < 0.7: Moderate correlation
- r < 0.3: Weak correlation

**Spearman Correlation:**
- Non-parametric alternative
- Based on ranks
- Detects monotonic relationships

### Simple Linear Regression

**Model equation:**
- y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
- β₀: intercept
- β₁: slope
- ε: error term

**Least squares estimation:**
- Minimizes sum of squared residuals
- β₁ = Σ((xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)) / Σ(xi - x̄)²

- Tests H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ = ...
- Alternative: at least one mean differs

**F-statistic:**
- F = MSB / MSW
- MSB: Mean Square Between groups
- MSW: Mean Square Within groups

**Assumptions:**
- Independence of observations
- Normality within groups
- Equal variances (homoscedasticity)

### Two-Way ANOVA

**Purpose:**
- Tests effects of two factors
- Main effects and interaction effects
- More complex experimental designs

**Effects tested:**
- Factor A main effect
- Factor B main effect
- A × B interaction effect

### Post-hoc Tests

**When to use:**
- After significant ANOVA result
- Determines which groups differ
- Controls for multiple comparisons

**Common tests:**
- Tukey's HSD
- Bonferroni correction
- Scheffé's method
- Duncan's test

## Practical Applications

### Choosing the Right Test

**Data type considerations:**
- Continuous vs. categorical
- Normal vs. non-normal distribution
- Independent vs. paired samples
- Sample size considerations

**Decision tree:**
1. What type of data?
2. How many groups?
3. What are you comparing?
4. Are assumptions met?
